                   <h4 class="sub-heading">What is an Apprenticeship?</h4>
                   <p>An Apprenticeship is a work-based training programme designed around the needs of employers, which leads to nationally-recognised qualifications for the apprentice.</p>
                   <p>Our programmes will ensure that your apprentice is properly trained to perform the job you need them to do and you may be eligible to receive government funding.</p>
                   <p>You can use Apprenticeships to recruit and train new employees as well as develop your existing staff to take your business where it needs to go.</p>
                   <h4 class="sub-heading">Who can apply?</h4>
                   <p>Any suitable company can apply.</p>
